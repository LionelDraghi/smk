[smk (SmartMake)](http://lionel.draghi.free.fr/smk/index.html)
==============================================================



**`smk` is a devastatingly simple and powerful make. So simple that you don't even have to write a Makefile.  
Just run your commands once through `smk`, and then, all you'll have to type is `smk`!  
`smk` will automatically check the modifications in the file system relevant for each command, and run only what have to!**

## Quick start

Let's start with a basic example : converting an audio file, changing tags, and renaming it according to the tag.

This is done thanks to those commands : 

```bash
# converting ogg to mp3:
sox x.ogg x.mp3
# setting Artist and Tittle tags:
id3v2 -a Luke -t Sentinelle x.mp3
# renaming according to tags:
id3ren -template='%a-%s.mp3' x.mp3
```

and will transform the `x.ogg` file into `Luke-Sentinelle.mp3`.

Let's run this through `smk`, thanks to the `run` command:

```bash
smk run sox x.ogg x.mp3
smk run id3v2 -a Luke -t Sentinelle x.mp3
smk run id3ren -template='%a-%s.mp3' x.mp3
```

Note that this test case, yet simple, is already fairly representative:  
- the first command is reading an input file and creating an output file,
- the second has the same file as input and output, 
- and the third is "moving" a file, that is deleting the input file. 

The uggly part of of the work is over, now all you have to do to get the things done is: 

```bash
smk
```

Note that you don't have to repeat the command line, unless there's more than one runfile in the directory.  

The result will be:

> Nothing to run

But if you modify an involved file:  

```bash
touch x.ogg
smk 
```

For more information on why is a command run, just give the `--explain` option (`-e` in short form).  
For instance:

```bash
rm Luke-Sentinelle.mp3
smk -e
```


## How is this possible? 

`smk` uses [`strace`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace), to understand what is read and what is written by each command, and thus what is a source, and what is a target.  
And this is why you don't have to manually give those information within a Makefile : **no more rules, recipes, dependencies, targets, etc.**

## Overview 

`smk` vocabulary is simple:  

- **Command** : commands are whatever can be run in the shell, from the simple `gcc` command above to script, or `make whatever`.

- **smkfile** : an smkfile is text file containing commands. It's the closest thing in `smk` to Makefile.  
The main differences are that smkfiles are simple : no cryptic syntax to describe rules or recipices, you don't need it. Both previous examples are valid smkfiles (yes, even the Makefile, `smk` can read very simple Makefile).  
And above all, smkfiles are not mandatory to use `smk`! 

- **Run** : a run is an execution of a command, or a list of command through an smkfile. This is what `smk` analyzes thanks to strace.

- **runfile** : runfiles are the internal files created by `smk` to store information about the various run, that is mainly : executed commands, when, source and target files and related time stamps. 

## Quick start tuto

Lest's imagine you convert on a regular basis audio files:
```
ffmpeg -i x.mp3 x.ogg
```
Just run it through `smk`:
```
smk run ffmpeg -i x.mp3 x.ogg
```
Once it's done, run it once more with just: 
```
smk
```
You don't have to repeat the command line, unless there's more than one runfile in the directory.  
The result will be:
> Nothing to run

Check what `smk` stored from this run:
```
smk status --long-listing
```

Note that common commands (here *status*), and options (here *--long-listing*) exist in short form. A strict equivalent is:
```
smk st -l
```

(More on commands and options with the usual `smk -h`)

Let's be back to the status:
> 2018-12-25 03:09:54.99 [] "ffmpeg -i x.mp3 x.ogg"  
>  Sources (1) :  
>  - 2018-12-25 02:06:10.00:/home/lionel/Proj/smk/tests/15_mp3_conversions/x.mp3  
>  Targets (1) :  
>  - 2018-12-25 03:09:59.00:/home/lionel/Proj/smk/tests/15_mp3_conversions/x.ogg  

Sources, targets and time stamp are obvious.  
(and yes, this example was written during christmas night!)

> **Cool feature #1** : `smk` output focus on useful files, system files are filtered by default.  
> (On my system, 166 system files are read by ffmpeg during this conversion, that you generally don't care!)  
> Note that this is only an output filter. `smk` manage all dependencies, and if whatever lib.so changes in /usr/lib, the command will be re-run.  
> To see system files involved, add the `-sa` (`--show-all-files`) option. 

And now:
```
touch x.mp3
smk -e
```
(`-e` stands for `--explain`)

> run "ffmpeg -i x.mp3 x.ogg" because /home/lionel/Proj/smk/tests/15_mp3_conversions/x.mp3 (2018-12-25 03:18:28.00) has been updated since last run (2018-12-25 02:06:10.00)  
ffmpeg -i x.mp3 x.ogg

etc.





## Cool features
### using `smk` without `smkfile`
### Whats new?
### Auto-clean

A short, but highly recommended, [`smk` tutorial](tutorial.md) is the best way to quickly start.  

And don't forget [`smk help`](cmd_line.md).

## Downloading and building

1. First, get the sources
   
   - Either donwload it on [the GitHub project page](https://github.com/LionelDraghi/smk)  

   - or directly with `git`:  
     > `git clone https://github.com/LionelDraghi/smk.git`

2. Go to the created `smk` directory

3. Ensure you have a gnat compiler (gcc Ada)  
   On Debian family:  
   >  `apt install gnat make`

   Or get the [GNAT Community Edition](https://www.adacore.com/download).

4. Build it:  
   > `gprbuild -p -P smk.gpr`
